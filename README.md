# Private order book - Limit order contract for secretAMM

[Issue Description](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork/issues/699)

TODO:
* TODO: Adapt frontend with these changes! Instead of query user orderbooks, have a dropdown with available pairs
	* TODO: Delete everything that relates to native tokens!
	* TODO: Delete User Orderbooks because to change the fees it will be hard and is adding gas cost!

* TODO: Implement the fee logic after the swap (trigger of a limit order)
* TODO: Admin can change the fees for an asset
* TODO: Redoo some logic of the check triggerer, dont want to have a loop there with max 10 entries
* TODO: OrderTriggererScript to verifiy multiple pairs at the same time (Nodejs backend?)
* TODO: SECURITY CHECK


* On the creation/execution of limit orders, a fee needs to be accomodated/payed to cover the triggerer gas prices
* This fee is transfered to the triggerer account when the swap message is received (Fee in Buy Token or Sell Token?)
* Clean some parts of the code that are not in use (clear native token and block native tokens)


* Future:
	* Statistics? TVL with band oracle integration

* Admin commands for updating?

## Limitations
* Centralized way of triggering on each block
* No fee taking to accomodate the triggerer gas fees

## What's done?
### Secret Order Book Factory Contract
* Handles
    * CreateViewingKey => For users to create their VK to see their Limit Orders
    * ChangeSecretOrderBookContractCodeId => For Admin to change the Secret Order Book Contract codeid (code updates, ...)
    * NewSecretOrderBookInstanciate => Create a nem Secret Order Book for a specific pair of the AMM
    * InitCallBackFromSecretOrderBookToFactory => Callback from the previous method, so it receives the address that the contract was instanciated and save it for query.
    * AddOrderBookToUser => Called from Secret Order Book Contracts to associate a user to a order book contract (for query purposes)
    * RemoveOrderBookFromUser => Called from Secret Order Book Contracts to remove an association of a user to a order book contract (for query purposes)
* Queries
    * IsKeyValid => Called by Secret Order Book Contracts to check if a user provided the correct vk
    * SecretOrderBookContractCodeId => Get the current Secret Order Book code id for new instanciated contracts
    * SecretOrderBooks => Get the address of the secret order book associated with a specific amm pair
    * UserSecretOrderBooks => Get secret order book contracts where a user have some orders
### Secret Order Book Contract
* Handles
    * Receive => Create Limit Order from SNIP20 Tokens
    * ReceiveNativeToken => Create Limit Order from the native token
    * WithdrawLimitOrder => Widthdraw assets locked on a limit order
    * TriggerLimitOrders
* Queries
    * OrderBookPairInfo => Returns info about the tokens and the associated amm pair contract address
