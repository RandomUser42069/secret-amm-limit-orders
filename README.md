# Private order book - Limit order contract for secretAMM

[Issue Description](https://github.com/enigmampc/SecretNetwork/issues/699)

TODO:
* Pagination
* Statistics?
* On the creation/execution of limit orders, a fee needs to be accomodated/payed to cover the triggerer gas prices

* Admin commands for updating?
* Clean some parts of the code that are not in use (clear native token and block native tokens)
* refactor everything for token0 and token1
* security revision
## Limitations
* No Native token (for now)
* Centralized way of triggering on each block
* No fee taking to accomodate the triggerer gas fees
